I think that there is an opportunity to write and explain concepts and ideas that are very well-known for those who made a career in Information Technology, but are remains obscure and cryptic for others.

For example:

- How private and public key works.
- How encoding and decoding works.
- How compression works.
- What is an algorithm? 
- What are the FAANG companies?
- What is Data Science? What are the difference between data analyst, data engineer and data scientific?
- A classic, what is big data? 
- What is Deep Learning? What is Machine Learning? 
- How domains works? What is an IP? Are domain and IP the same? What is a protocol?
