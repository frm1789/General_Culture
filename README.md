# Some ideas to develop

I think that there is an opportunity to write and explain concepts and ideas that are very well-known for those who made a career in Information Technology, but are remains obscure and cryptic for others.

For example:

- How encoding and decoding works.
- How compression works.
- What are the FAANG companies?
- What is Data Science? What are the difference between data analyst, data engineer and data scientific?
- What is Deep Learning? What is Machine Learning? 
- How domains works? What is an IP? Are domain and IP the same? What is a protocol?
- What volatile means?
- How Spark works? What are the difference between Spark and Hadop? Hint: Dynamic size of block.

Another set of ideas:
- (Hands on tutorial) How private and public key works: Using putty
- (Hands on tutorial) How to create your own map reduce in python
- (Hands on tutorial) How to work with Hive
- (Hands on tutorial) How to work with Hadoop streaming.
